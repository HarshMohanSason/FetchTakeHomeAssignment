### Steps to Run the App:
1. Download the zip file
2. Create a separate folder named FetchTakeHomeAssignment and extract the zip files in that folder
3. Run the code using command + R in Xcode

### Focus Areas: 
I focused more on writing robust and simple code to fetch the data appropriately from the URL, implementing caching and writing testcases instead of making the UI very pretty. I focused more on this because UI can always be prettier, look better but the main logic part of the code should work correctly. 

### Time Spent: 
I spent approximately 2 hours on this project. I allocated around 35-40 minutes for the UI and rest for writing testcases, implementing correct structures, caching, checking for all states,errors etc. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions:
I did make trade-offs with the UI. I focused more on writing clean and robust code to handle test cases, states, fetching data correctly, instead of making the UI very pretty

### Weakest Part of the Project:
I believe the weakest part of the project would be the UI not being very pretty and not using more advance methods such as using protocols and extending them and then using dependency injection in the class to write more robust test cases instead of simply using the instance to run the functions in the testcases

### Additional Information:
Overall, this assignment wasn't hard at all. Quite easy. I haven't focused on making the UI very attractive, I focused more on writing clean and robust code to fetch data appropriately, writing test cases etc.
